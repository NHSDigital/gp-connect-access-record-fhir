    ## Overview

    ![GP Connect Patient Facing Access Record FHIR Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NHSDigital/gp-connect-access-record-fhir/master/specification/images/overview_diagram.svg)

    Use this API to access structured and coded information from a patient's GP practice record to consume in a patient facing service. The API accesses GP principal supplier systems and provides a consistent interface and data model.
    
    You can retrieve patient record data for the following:

    - medications
    - allergies
    - immunisations
    - consultations
    - problems
    - investigations
    - attachments
    - uncategorised data (other clinically coded items that are present in the record)

    You cannot currently use this API to:

    - write back to the GP record

    ## Who can use this API

    This API can be used by developers of patient facing systems that support patients gaining access to their GP practice medical record.    
    
    This API:

    * is intended only for use by patient-facing applications

    * is intended only for non-clinical use

    * can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so

    Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with development. To do this, contact us. 

    You must do this before you can go live (see Onboarding below).

    ### Prerequisites 

    #### Information governance (IG)
    
    You must:

    * be compliant with the GP Connect Direct Care API Information Governance Model

    #### Clinical safety 

    You must:

    * have a clinical safety officer (CSO) who is responsible for DCB0129 and, if necessary, DCB0160. For more on clinical risk management, visit Clinical risk management standards

    If you have any other queries, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support)

    ## Service level

    This API is a silver service, meaning it is operational 24 x 7 x 365 but only supported during business hours (8am to 6pm), Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays.
    
    For more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).

    ## Technology
    This API is a FHIR API.

    It receives a FHIR STU3 payload.

    For more details, see [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir).
    
    ### Resources

    Use the [GP Connect Patient Facing Access Record Implementation Guide](https://simplifier.net/guide/pfs-implementation-guide/Home?version=current) to assist with your integration.

    This is the FHIR specification for GP Connect Access Record - FHIR API.

    ## Network access

    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).

    For more details, see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).
    
    ## Security and authorisation

    This API is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis), meaning an end user must be present and authenticated to use it. 

    The end user must be:

    * a patient

    * authenticated with NHS login to P9 identity verification level

    The API uses Open ID Connect to authenticate the end user and OAuth 2.0 to authorise the calling system. It supports the following security pattern using NHS login: 
    
    * [User-restricted RESTful APIs - NHS login separate authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-login-separate-authentication-and-authorisation)

    | Production       | Not yet available

    ### Sandbox testing

    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):

    * is for early developer testing
 
    * only covers a limited set of scenarios
 
    * is stateless, so it does not store data
 
    * is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation

    For more details on sandbox testing, or to try out the sandbox using our "Try this API" feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.
    
    ### Integration testing (not yet available)

    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):

    * is for formal integration testing
 
    * is stateful, so it does persist data
 
    * includes authorisation

    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).

    ## Onboarding

    This API is not yet available for onboarding.

    ### Hazard log

    The GP Connect Access Record: Structured generic hazard log shows you the clinical risks of using GP Connect functionality through a consumer system. Use it to identify the clinical risks of consuming clinical data and presenting it in your system, and record these in your own system-specific hazard log. If necessary, take mitigating action to ensure clinical safety.

    ## Errors

    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:

    - 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action

    - 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application

    - 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server

    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.
